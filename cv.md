## About me

I am 33 years old and currently working as a data analyst at Mapbox. In my work, I often use SQL queries, create metrics and dashboards in analytical programs (Athena, Mode Analytics).

Over the three years of work in the IT, I constantly learn something new and acquire new skills. I get along well with people and a good team player. Recently I took courses in project management, which gave me an understanding of approaches to work organization and project management.

I like programming because it allows you to implement your ideas and have things done.
